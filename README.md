# HTML_CSS_Template_one
HTML_CSS_Design_one
This is my first project in HTML, and the original version of this project was created by the software engineer Osama Elzero. You can find the original template here.

As part of my effort to master programming, I studied this project and recreated it using HTML and CSS. I learned both tools through Osama Elzero's website (elzero.org).

In conclusion, I extend my deepest thanks and gratitude to Osama Elzero for his continuous efforts in helping others learn and grow in the field of programming.
